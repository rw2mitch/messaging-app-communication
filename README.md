Python and PHP scripts for sending messages through a server.

This project has an interesting story behind it. A friend of mine wrote a program similar to a cipher machine in the now obsolete Turing language, which was developed in 1982 by two UofT computer scientists. The program was designed to send and receive messages, but was unable to communicate through the internet. Thus, I wrote a couple Python and PHP scripts to allow it to communicate

Turing is unable to directly communicate with Python scripts, so we had the Turing program read and write to text files in order to communicate.
